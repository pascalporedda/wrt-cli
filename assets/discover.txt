You are generating a repo-local configuration file for a developer tool called "wrt".

Goal: enable parallel git worktrees for agentic coding by providing:
- package manager install command
- services/dev commands and how to offset ports to avoid collisions
- whether Supabase local dev is used, and its base ports (from supabase/config.toml if present)
- database tooling info: whether the repo has DB migrations/seeding and how to run migrate/seed/reset

Instructions:
- Inspect files in the current repo.
- Prefer explicit data from config files over guesses.
- Use WRT_PORT_OFFSET (integer) as the offset to add to base ports.
- Emit ONLY valid JSON matching the provided JSON Schema.
- IMPORTANT: Do not omit object fields. If a field is unknown/unset, use null.

Output guidance:
- version: 1
- port_block_size: 100
- package_manager: best detected ("unknown" if unclear)
- services: include major apps/services with their dev command as argv array
- database: detect DB tooling and provide commands (argv arrays) for migrate/seed/reset if the repo has them
  - Only support these tooling kinds: supabase, prisma, sqlx. If unclear, set database.kind to "unknown" or null.
  - Prefer providing a reset command when possible (reset is the best "one-shot" local setup).
  - Supabase:
    - Detect via `supabase/` and/or `supabase/config.toml`.
    - Set database.kind="supabase".
    - reset_command: ["supabase","db","reset"] (preferred).
    - migrate_command/seed_command: optional; can be null if reset covers it.
  - Prisma:
    - Detect via `prisma/schema.prisma` (or schema.prisma).
    - Set database.kind="prisma".
    - Prefer package.json scripts if present (db:reset/db:seed/db:migrate). If no scripts, use npx:
      - reset_command: ["npx","prisma","migrate","reset"] (destructive).
      - migrate_command: ["npx","prisma","migrate","dev"] (may be interactive; use scripts if available).
      - seed_command: ["npx","prisma","db","seed"] (if configured).
  - SQLx (Rust):
    - Detect via Cargo.toml containing "sqlx" and/or `sqlx-data.json` and/or `migrations/`.
    - Set database.kind="sqlx".
    - migrate_command: ["cargo","sqlx","migrate","run"] (if migrations exist).
    - reset_command: often not available; set null unless the repo defines a clear reset script/command.
    - seed_command: set null unless the repo has an explicit seed script.
- supabase.detected: true only if supabase/config.toml exists
- supabase.config_path: "supabase/config.toml" if detected, otherwise null
- supabase.start_command: ["supabase","start"] if detected, otherwise null
- supabase.base_ports: include any known ports (null for unknown ports; null for the whole object if not detected)
