You are generating a repo-local configuration file for a developer tool called "wrt".

Goal: enable parallel git worktrees for agentic coding by providing:
- package manager install command
- services/dev commands and how to offset ports to avoid collisions
- whether Supabase local dev is used, and its base ports (from supabase/config.toml if present)

Instructions:
- Inspect files in the current repo.
- Prefer explicit data from config files over guesses.
- Use WRT_PORT_OFFSET (integer) as the offset to add to base ports.
- Emit ONLY valid JSON matching the provided JSON Schema.
- IMPORTANT: Do not omit object fields. If a field is unknown/unset, use null.

Output guidance:
- version: 1
- port_block_size: 100
- package_manager: best detected ("unknown" if unclear)
- services: include major apps/services with their dev command as argv array
- supabase.detected: true only if supabase/config.toml exists
- supabase.config_path: "supabase/config.toml" if detected, otherwise null
- supabase.start_command: ["supabase","start"] if detected, otherwise null
- supabase.base_ports: include any known ports (null for unknown ports; null for the whole object if not detected)
